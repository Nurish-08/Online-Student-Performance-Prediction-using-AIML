## Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing steps such as label encoding and scaling.
- Visualizing mappings of original and encoded categorical values.
- Handling missing data, normalizing features, and splitting datasets for training and testing.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Automated handling of categorical and numerical data.
- **Scalable Encoding**: Displays label-encoded mappings for better interpretability.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Includes cells for real-time modifications and outputs.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning preprocessing and scaling.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: (Optional) For data visualization.
- **Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name

## Usage
Run the notebook step-by-step:
  Load your dataset by replacing the sample file in the data folder.
  Execute the data preprocessing and encoding cells.
  Use the output to understand the mappings for label encoding.
Customize the notebook:
  Modify preprocessing steps to suit your dataset.
  Add additional machine learning models or visualizations as needed.
Export results:
  Save the processed data or encoded mappings as CSV files if needed.
